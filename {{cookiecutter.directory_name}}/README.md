## ⚙️ Usage

First, you need to install the dependencies (if you have not already done):

```shell
$ npm install
```

Now start the development server:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

The presentation will run locally at http://localhost:3000.

You can edit the `index.html` and `src/main.js` so that it reloads automatically.

## 📦 Build

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates a `dist` folder containing all the statics of the presentation.
